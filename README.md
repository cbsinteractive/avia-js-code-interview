Code Interview for Avia JS

## Overview
The following tasks are meant to be completed in a reasonable amount of time. The goal is to see how you approach a problem and how you structure your code. We are not looking for a perfect solution, but rather a solution that is well thought out and well structured. We are also not looking for a complete solution, but rather a solution that is complete enough to demonstrate your skills. Please feel free to ask any questions you may have.

1. Write a utility function that loads the following HLS manifest and parses it into a list of objects describing each stream rendition:
    - https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8
    
1. Using react, render each item in a HTML list in ascending order of bandwidth. Display the following properties for each item:
    - the name
    - resolution
    - bandwidth
    - codecs

## Structure
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](http://create-react-app.dev/). You can run the app in the development mode by running the `npm start` command. This will start a local server on port 3000. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

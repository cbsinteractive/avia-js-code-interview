Code Interview for Avia JS

## Prerequisites

1. Disable all code AI helpers like Github Copilot, AWS Whisperer, etc.

1. Share your entire screen with us during the interview.

## Questions
The following tasks are meant to be completed in a reasonable amount of time. The goal is to see how you approach a problem and how you structure your code. We are not looking for a perfect solution, but rather a solution that is well thought out and well structured. We are also not looking for a complete solution, but rather a solution that is complete enough to demonstrate your skills. Please feel free to ask any questions you may have.

### Task 
> Write a utility function that loads the following HLS manifest and parses it into a list of objects describing each stream rendition:
>    - https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8 
>
> The object should contain the following properties:
>    - url
>    - program id
>    - name
>    - resolution
>    - bandwidth
>    - codecs
    
### Bonus
> After completing step 1, using react, render each item in a HTML list in ascending order of bandwidth.

## Structure
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](http://create-react-app.dev/). You can run the app in the development mode by running the `npm start` command. This will start a local server on port 3000. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
